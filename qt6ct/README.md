  qt6ct configuration/dot files

Below I've included screenshots of different tools that use qt6ct theming with different colorschemes so you can get an idea of the potential styles. I have also split them up into categories with Hyprland transparency effects enabled/disabled so you can get a better idea of how things might look on *your* system. All colorschemes shown are available within this branch of the repository, along with extras.

>  [!TIP]
>  To perfectly recreate what you see in the screenshots, download and select the 'Breeze" style. The different wallpapers you see are also available within my dotfiles GitHub repository.

First, here's the screenshots with Hyprland's transparency effects enabled, and varying wallpapers for demonstration:

*(I've cropped my status bar to focus purely on the qt6ct themed applications)*

While the above results look nice IMO, they may not exactly match yours if you are using a different DE, or simply don't have transparency effects enabled. Luckily, I took screenshots with transparency effects disabled and only one consistent wallpaper throughout so you can get a better idea of what *exactly* each theme is doing:
